# cta4j Java SDK

A lightweight Java SDK for interacting with the [Chicago Transit Authority (CTA)](https://www.transitchicago.com/) APIs — both Train Tracker and Bus Tracker.  
Built for simplicity, reliability, and minimal external dependencies.

---

## 🚆 Overview

`cta4j-java-sdk` provides a clean, type-safe interface for accessing CTA's public transit data.  
It wraps the official Train and Bus Tracker APIs with intuitive Java models and error handling.

**Features:**
- Simple, dependency-light HTTP client (uses Apache HttpClient 5)
- DTOs modeled as Java records
- Works with both **Train Tracker** and **Bus Tracker** APIs

---

## 🔑 Getting API Keys

You'll need a free API key from CTA to use the SDK.

- **Train Tracker API** → [Apply here](https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/traintrackerapply/)
- **Bus Tracker API** → [Apply here](https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/bustracker/)

After applying, you'll receive an API key by email. Keep it safe — you'll use it when initializing the client.

## 🧩 Example Usage

### Fetch upcoming train arrivals for a station

```java
import com.cta4j.client.TrainClient;

public final class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TrainClient trainClient = new TrainClient("TRAIN_API_KEY");

        trainClient.getStationArrivals("41320")
                   .stream()
                   .map(arrival -> String.format(
                       "%s-bound %s Line train is arriving at %s in %d minutes",
                       arrival.destinationName(),
                       arrival.route(),
                       arrival.stationName(),
                       arrival.etaMinutes()
                   ))
                   .forEach(System.out::println);

        // Example output:
        // Howard-bound RED Line train is arriving at Belmont in 1 minutes
        // 95th/Dan Ryan-bound RED Line train is arriving at Belmont in 2 minutes
        // Kimball-bound BROWN Line train is arriving at Belmont in 4 minutes
        // Loop-bound BROWN Line train is arriving at Belmont in 5 minutes
    }
}
```

### Fetch upcoming bus arrivals for a stop

```java
import com.cta4j.client.BusClient;

public final class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BusClient busClient = new BusClient("BUS_API_KEY");

        busClient.getStopArrivals("22", "1828")
                 .stream()
                 .map(arrival -> String.format(
                     "%s-bound bus is arriving at %s in %d minutes",
                     arrival.destination(),
                     arrival.stopName(),
                     arrival.etaMinutes()
                 ))
                 .forEach(System.out::println);

        // Example output:
        // Harrison-bound bus is arriving at Clark & Belmont in 1 minutes
        // Harrison-bound bus is arriving at Clark & Belmont in 26 minutes
    }
}
```

## 🧠 Design Goals

- **Dependency-light**: no Spring, Feign, or Lombok
- **Modern Java**: uses records and Apache HttpClient 5
- **Framework-agnostic**: works in any Java 21+ project

---

## 🛠️ Planned Improvements

- Add test coverage
- Improve error handling and logging
- Add support for more API endpoints, like service alerts
- Implement caching for frequently requested data
- Add asynchronous request support
